NEW:

- Disabled the option to add hubs to home screen when `Automatic Home` is enabled

FIXED:

- Fixed metadata line height issue on some preplay pages
- Fixed an issue where some manually added hubs never loaded properly (requires re-adding those hubs to the home screen)
- Fixed an issue that could cause loss of focus when switching between custom and auto home
- Fixed an issue that sometimes made it impossible to reorder home hubs
